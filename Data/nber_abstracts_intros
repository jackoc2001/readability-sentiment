6861,JPE,1979-06-01,Inflation and the Choice of Asset Life,"This paper considers the choice of capital durability by competitive firms subject to a corporate income tax. We find that, with a positive rate of inflation, a historic cost depreciation rule biases the choice of asset life toward greater durability and lowers the market valuation of a firm's capital assets. Extending the familiar one-sector monetary growth model to incorporate this behavior, we explore the general equilibrium effects that the failure to index depreciation allowances for inflation may have on the long-run characteristics of the economy, including the capital-labor ratio and the rate of return received by investors.",English,NA,NA,87,3,1,621,638,NA,Alan J.

This paper presents a model of competitive behavior in which firms may choose the durability of their capital goods. We find that in the presence of inflation, the taxation of corporate profits may influence both the choice of asset life and the market value of equity. In particular, the failure to index depreciation allowances depresses share values and biases the choice of asset life toward greater durability.

Tobin showed that, by lowering the real return on money, inflation makes real capital more attractive as an asset and leads to capital deepening and a lower real rate of return. By including personal and corporate income taxes in the specification of this model, Feldstein (1976) has found that the failure to index these taxes for inflation may also have a substantial impact on the economy's steady-state characteristics. One aspect of the problem which has not been adequately explored is the effect of inflation on the production decisions of firms. The current structure of the US corporate income tax has the effect of greatly distorting investment decisions among various assets. The investment tax credit may be applied to purchases of certain equipment, but not structures. Even in the absence of inflation, depreciation schedules used for tax purposes do not mirror true economic depreciation.^"" With the advent of inflation, this distortion is compounded by the fact that these schedules are based on the original or ""historic"" cost and not the replacement cost of the capital being depreciated. ^ In the next section, we present a model of competitive firm behavior when the durability of capital is subject to choice by the firm."

The analytical framework is based on the principles of inventory management which have been applied by Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956) to study the transactions demand for money. The key feature of our model is its stochastic characteristics which lead to the need for precautionary reserves. We analyze the determinants of optimal money holdings when net disbursements are governed by a stochastic process. In this context we adopt some aspect of the analytical framework that has been developed by Miller and Orr (1966). Section II contains the analytical framework of the model and the formal derivation of optimal money holdings. In this context we analyze the determinants of the various elasticities of the demand for money.

A considerable literature has grown covering econometric methodology and applications to a wide variety of situations.* In a few specific cases, 2 estimates of discrete choice models have been employed for welfare analysis. Travel demand researchers have developed ""composite cost"" and ""accessibility"" measures to evaluate the desirability of various states (Williams [1977], Ben-Akiva and Lerman [1978]), but the relationship of these to conventional welfare criteria has not been thoroughly explored. Indeed, very little has been said in general regarding the validity of the tools of applied welfare economics in discrete choice situations. Nevertheless, in at least two areas in which discrete choice models are applied, welfare judgments are of paramount interest. The first is the analysis of taxes and subsidies. Econometric studies of the impacts of taxes on labor supply, savings, and housing decisions have permitted calculation of the welfare 3 cost or ""excess burden"" of the tax feature under consideration. Traditionally, such studies have assumed that the taxed activity will be pursued regardless of the existence of the tax."
6645,JPE,1981-10-01,Intraindustry Specialization and the Gains from Trade,"Several recent empirical studies of trade suggest that interindustry specialization and trade, which reflect the conventional forces of comparative advantage, are also accompanied by intraindustry specialization, which reflects scale economies and consumers' taste for a diversity of products. This paper develops a simple model which illustrates this argument. Two main results are developed. First, the nature of trade depends on how similar countries are in their factor endowments. As countries become more similar, the trade between them will increasingly become intraindustry in character. Second, the effects of opening trade depend on its type. If intraindustry trade is sufficiently dominant, the advantages of extending the market will outweigh the distributional effects, and the owners of scarce as well as of abundant factors will be better off.",English,NA,NA,89,5,1,959,973,NA,Paul R.

This paper develops a model which attempts to explain this observation, while at the same time making sense of some other puzzling empirical aspects of world trade. The basis of the model is a distinction between two kinds of trade: ""Heckscher-Ohlin"" trade, based on differences in factor proportions, and ""intraindustry"" trade, based on scale economies and product differentiation. To incorporate intraindustry trade into the model it is necessary to drop the usual assumptions of constant returns to scale and perfect competition; instead the paper deals with a world where economies of scale are pervasive and all firms possess some monopoly power. Surprisingly, it is nonetheless possible to develop a fully-worked-out general equilibrium model which remains simple and can be used to compare autarky and free trade. Two main results emerge from the analysis. First, the nature of trade depends on how similar countries are in their factor endowments. As countries become more similar, the trade between them will increasingly become intra-industry in character. Second, the effects of opening trade depend on its type.

The changes in relative goods prices that come with expanded trade produce changes in the distribution of income; and in the simple models which make up the core of trade theory these changes in income distribution invariably leave the owners of some factors of production absolutely worse off. The implication is that trade liberalization always involves trading off gains for some against losses for others, suggesting that moves toward freer trade will occur only rarely and after severe political struggles."

Most of this work has gone unnoticed in the empirical literature. This study synthesizes existing knowledge into an estimable model of labor supply that incorporates life cycle factors, and relates it to empirical models typically found in the literature. A full life cycle model of hours of work is estimated using data on prime age males from the Michigan Panel on Income Dynamics. Most empirical work on labor supply ignores life cycle theory, assuming instead a one-period model. Typically, annual hours of work are regressed on the current hourly wage rate and some measure of property income. A worker, however, determines his current labor supply in a life cycle setting. Unless credit markets are ""perfectly imperfect"" and there is no human capital accumulation, the supply of labor is a function of current and future discounted wage rates as well as wealth and constraints in other periods."

We find the parameter implications of both the wage bill maximization hypothesis and the rent maximization hypothesis to provide inferior explanations of the movement of wages and employment of these workers compared with our more general formulation.,NA,1981,20,0,0,0,1,0,NA,74,3,103,676,68,0.660194174757282,22.1244224422442,23.3048188118812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,6.5631067961165,0.398058252427184,199,1.93203883495146,"the, of, and, by, wages",0.00739644970414201,Unknown Journal,6.81382838283832,20.6726732673267,24.5557755775578,20.5818281535008,-0.616138613861384,33.6666666666667,1.96039603960396,0,0,NA;NA,NA;NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,2,RAND; Stanford U; NBER,Unknown Journal,0,0,0,8,2,2,0,1,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0.666666666666667,0,1,-1,3,2,0.2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1980,2483,"Although empirical studies measuring the effects of trade unions have multiplied in the last few years, the behavioral underpinnings of unionism remain poorly understood.

This ""vicious circle"" view of the current arrangements holds that inflationary asset-market disturbances entail short-term exchange-rate movements which feed into domestic price levels and may set off successive, explosive rounds of wage-price inflation and further exchangerate depreciation.3 The concern is reflected in the emphasis on exchangerate surveillance in the revised Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, in the adoption of informal exchange-rate targets by most central banks, and in the emergence of more formal arrangements to limit the degree of exchange-rate flexibility, such as the European Monetary System."

There are, however, other social institutions which affect the income distribution and their actions may either reinforce or countervail those of the government. The family plays a major role in this respect. The effect of the family on the distribution of income depends on the variation in individual characteristics within and between families and on the rules for allocation of family resources. We are interested in a particular aspect of this problem: the allocation of parental resources among children of different abilities and its effect on the distribution of their future income and welfare. The nature of the problem can be illustrated by means of a very simple example. Consider two families, each consisting of two children. Let the parents of each family have the same wealth. Children are distinguished solely by their endowed ability. Suppose that half the children's population is of 'high ability' and half of 'low ability.' One possibility is that all differences in ability are within families and hence each family has one 'able' and one 'less able' child."

The underlying cost structure appears to have substantial costs of changing production as well as substantial costs of being away from target inventory, the latter being a function of current sales. Given this cost structure, whether inventory behavior is stabilizing or destabilizing depends on the characteristics of the demand process. In the automobile industry, inventory behavior is destabilizing: the variance of production is larger than the variance of sales.",NA,1983,36,0,0,0,1,0,NA,187,6,122,778,65,0.532786885245902,15.5325297619048,21.7447803571429,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,6.37704918032787,0.385245901639344,227,1.86065573770492,"the, of, is, inventory, behavior",0.012853470437018,Unknown Journal,16.4222619047619,15.6060714285714,19.252380952381,16.5266775795477,16.3432142857143,18.6666666666667,2.02678571428571,0,0,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,1,Harvard U,Unknown Journal,0,0,2,18,1,1,0,1,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,-1,2,1,0.333333333333333,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1980,4294,"There is substantial agreement in macroeconomics about the importance of inventory behavior in the business cycle.

One method is the continuous time adaptation of the method of Blanchard and Kahn. To obtain a unique solution there must be as many linearly independent boundary conditions as there are linearly independent state variables. Three slightly different versions of a well-known small open economy macroeconomic model are used to illustrate three fairly general ways of specifying the required boundary conditions. The first represents the standard case in which the number of stable characteristic roots equals the number of predetermined variables. The second represents the case when the number of stable roots exceeds the number of predetermined variables but a sufficient number of linear restrictions on the state variables at an initial date is given to guarantee a unique solution. The third represents the case when the ""missing"" initial conditions have been replaced by boundary conditions that involve linear restrictions on the values of the state variables across an initial and a future date.

This issue is especially important for financial policy and foreign exchange market intervention and exchange rate management. Financial policy instruments, be they financial asset stocks, interest rates or exchange rates can be adjusted virtually continuously and costlessly. Some financial market data (eg, exchange rate observations, stock prices and transactions in government debt) are observable and available on a fairly current basis. Such currently observable data provide information about the sources of random shocks to the economy. Financial policy should be conducted in such a way as to extract the information contained in observable financial market data and exploit it in achieving the authorities' stabilization objectives. In this paper I evaluate the effect of general linear policy rules on the behavior of a number of stochastic linear rational expectations models.

The standard deviation of real stock market returns appears to be about 20 percent per year. Over the last 15 years the price of used capital goods as measured in the stock market relative to consumption goods has varied by a factor of more than two. Comparable volatility is observed in the pricing of used capital goods such as airplanes and office building where an active second-hand market exists. It seems clear that realistic positive or normative analysis of the effects of capital income taxation requires models in which there is substantial scope for variation in the price of capital assets. Yet, the substantial literature on capital income taxes and risk taking has focused almost entirely on models where the return from capital goods is variable but their relative price is certain. This paper reconsiders the effects of taxes on the return from risky assets, recognizing the importance of variations in the price of capital goods. The results suggest that the burden of the corporate income tax is much greater than that implied by analyses such as Gordon (1981) , Stiglitz (1969) and Feldstein (1971), suggesting that it falls primarily on the risk premium on corporate equity. The essential error in earlier analyses is in the treatment of depreciation."

Evidence both pro and con has been advanced. Recently, this question has been illuminated by the realization that the hypothesis of rational expectations, in conjunction with the PIH, imposes strong restrictions on the stochastic properties of consumption conditional on income. In pioneering articles, Hall (1978) and Sargent (1978) used these restrictions to test the joint rational expectations - permanent income hypothesis in the US time series data. Flavin (forthcoming) has shown that, properly interpreted, the Hall and Sargent papers concur in rejecting the joint hypothesis. Noting the relatively low power of time series tests, Hall and Mishkin (forthcoming) followed by applying these methods (and several 4 innovations) in panel data. The results of their analysis of the relation of food consumption to income change were ambiguous; the PIH could not be clearly accepted or rejected. One feature of this recent research has been the small amount of attention paid to the durables component of consumer expenditure: Of the papers mentioned, only Sargent's does not completely eliminate durables from the measure of consumption. The reason for this neglect is that the theory, as developed, is a predictor of actual consumption; what is observed, however, is not consumption but expenditure."

One obvious reason to analyze the current account is that governments and policymakers care about it, and intervene to affect it. The goal is often said to be a balanced current account, although from the point of view of economic theory that has no particular virtue. What is at stake is of course what might be, in some sense, the optimal current account, and whether observed actual current accounts deviate from the optimal ones. In order to specify what might be optimal, we must first understand how the equilibrium current account of a relatively frictionless economy is determined, and what the equilibrium response to various disturbances look like. Another obvious reason is that international economists like to explain international capital movements, which immediately leads to the current account since it is identically equal to a country's net accumulation of foreign assets."

In explaining how monetary expansion can - particularly in hyperinflation - cause a more than proportional rise in prices, the conventional wisdom is that expected inflation leads people to economize on their real money holdings. In analyzing the costs of high inflation an important role is assigned to the costs associated with reduced real balances; ie, reduced ""liquidity"". In spite of the importance that is attached to the idea of a demand for real balances which depends on expected inflation, however, this idea has never been given a really secure micro-economic foundation. The standard Baumol-Tobin model of the demand for money is a model of a single individual, which has never been integrated into a description of a market. Approaches which place money in the utility function, such as Brock (1975), are suggestive but essentially assume the result. ""Cash-in-advance"" models, like that of Wilson (1979), seem to imply that a capital market drives monetary velocity to its technological maximum independently of the rate of inflation."

As Tobin I198O] discusses, this effect is central to the traditional conclusions that tax changes might have a useful role in short-run stabilization policy and that persistent government deficits reduce the steady-state capital stock. This view of debt finance is implicit in many policy discussions regarding the large current Federal deficits. One possible objection to this conventional view, first noted by Ricardo, is that it ignores the future tax liabilities implicit in debt finance. In any finite horizon model, for example, the government mist at some point levy taxes to repay the debt. The present value of the future taxes exactly equals the value of the debt. If the planning horizon of individuals is at least as long as the horizon over which the debt is repaid, then the replacement of current taxes with future taxes could not increase individuals' perceived wealth. In this world, therefore, government bonds do not stimulate consumer spending."

The dissatisfaction with the estimated neoclassical investment equations is not based on the ""fit"" of these equations or on shifts in these equations; rather, the problem arises from the difficulty of interpreting the estimated distributed lags. Are we to interpret these distributed lags as expectational lags, as delivery lags, or perhaps, more likely, as some convolution of expectationa1 and delivery lags? An alternative approach to the estimation of investment equations uses the q theory of investment Tobin (1969) which is based on the cost of adjustment literature developed by Eisner and Strotz (1963), Lucas (1967a, b), Gould (1968), and Treadway (1969)."

This paper offers some plausible estimates of investment dynamics that are both consistent with a structural model and useful for policy analysis. Because the choice of capital stock is inherently connected with the choice of other factors, labor in particular, the model is of capacity choice in general instead of investment in particular. When a firm purchases or hires factors of production, it determines its productive capacity. Short-run variation in output comes principally from variation in factors that are adjustable at little or no cost. Investment responds relatively slowly to shocks because of adjustment costs. In this paper I provide structural estimates of demand for factors--- capital in particular. These estimates can be used for analyses of tax policy that are immune from the Lucas critique. The dynamic response of investment implied by the estimates is more plausible than that found in previous research. I use a model where the firm maximizes the present discounted value of profits subject to a technology with adjustment costs. Such a specification has a long history in the investment literature. Moreover, it is a generalization of Tobin's q-model, which is equivalent to an adjustment cost model where only capital is costly to adjust. The firm chooses its capital stock, its number of production and non-production workers, and hours of production workers. I estimate the first-order conditions, or Euler equations, of the problem rather than the closed-form decision rules. The estimation technique is Hansen's [1982] generalized method of moments."

Perhaps the most striking rejections use data at only the short end of the maturity spectrum. Recently, Fama [1984], Jones and Roley [1983], Mankiw and Summers [1984], and Shiller, Campbell, and Schoenholtz [1983] all conclude that yields on Treasury bills of less than one year do not obey the expectations theory.

One outstanding puzzle regards the interaction between government purchases and real interest rates. Standard neoclassical analysis, as presented by Barro [1984] for example, implies that permanent increases in government purchases should not affect real interest rates while temporary increases in government purchases should increase real interest rates. Data for the United States, however, provide no support for this prediction. Wars are the classic example. As Barro [1984, pp. 315-316] documents, wars are not associated with high real interest rates. To the extent any systematic effect is present in US data, real interest rates appear lower during wars. In this paper I study an extention of the standard infinite horizon neoclassical growth model and propose an explanation for this apparent anomaly. My analysis is in the spirit of much recent work that examines the dynamic effects of fiscal policy in neoclassical models.2 Most previous studies, however, do not explicitly include consumer durable goods. Introducing consumer durable goods is a natural way of modifying the consumer's utility function so that it is not separable through time.3 Alternatively, one can view consumer durable goods as being another use of accumulated wealth. I show that a simple neoclassical model incorporating a non-durable consumer good, a durable consumer good, and a durable producer good generates -2- a perhaps surprising dynamic response to changes in government purchases."

This can occur despite the fact that the equilibrium rate of return on bequeathable wealth is lower than the equilibrium rate of return on annuities. Given uncertain lifetimes, the voluntary private accumulation of bequeathable wealth generates involuntary bequests.

We present an alternative aggregate model with microeconomic price stickiness which emphasizes the importance of endogenous timing of price adjustments. The model provides conditions under which money shocks have no real effects. A number of macro economic models of price stickiness have a common microeconomic base: infrequent but large changes in nominal variables are assumed to be more economical then frequent small changes. The models also share the assumption that the time between successive price revisions is pre-set, and hence unresponsive to shocks to the economy."

Implicit both in Lucas's question and in a such a picture is the notion that output fluctuations are transitory. Certainly this view is implicit in the standard explanation of the business cycle: the natural rate of output grows at a more or less constant rate while output fluctuations represent temporary deviations from this natural rate. The purpose of this paper is to question this conventional view. In particular, we examine one simple implication for the univariate properties of economic t-ime series.

In the 1920's the Harvard Economic Service (HES) issued monthly reports on the current and their expected future state of the economy. HES used three indices, representing speculation, business, and money, to help predict the future. Crum said that in the summer of 1929 the statistical assistant at HES became alarmed when she noticed that the charts indicated that a sharp downturn in economic activity was imminent. Crum did not see in the current business situation any cause for this adverse forecast. Moreover, he feared that a pessimistic forecast by the influential service could itself have an adverse effect on financial markets and economic activity. Therefore, he suppressed the pessimistic findings of the assistant,1 and the published report did not speak of a potential downturn. The data, in fact, provide only mild support for this account. The account does, however, raise an interesting and general set of questions."

An example considered by Fischer (1980) is capital taxation in a two-period model. In that model a second period capital levy is first best from the perspective of period two, but third best from the perspective of period one. Since there is nothing in Fischer's model to enforce a government commitment against second period capital taxation, the ex post desire to engage in first best taxation drives the ex ante economy from a second to a third best outcome. Researchers have suggested a variety of ways to enforce optimal commitment policies. Kydland and Prescott (1977) argue for rules rather than discretion.

This paper derives and implements a method for estimating the ratio of price to marginal cost. The method Is different from the one used In most previous lnvestlgatlons-lnstead of assuming profit maximization and estimating the slope of the demand schedule (as In Rosse (1970)), it looks at actual changes in costs. Further, the method makes no assumptions about the cost function; it is completely nonparametrlc. In its simplest form, it estimates the ratio of price to marginal cost directly from data on price, output, and the quantities and prices of inputs. This form proves an exact basis for a test of the hypothesis that price equals marginal cost. It also can provide the basis for estimation in a non-competltlve setting when it Is plausible that price is a constant markup over marginal cost, as It would be for a seller facing a demand schedule with constant elasticity."

Several recent papers have made endogenous the actions of the labor union in an effort to understand both the way unions respond to changing international conditions and the implications of union 2ff behavior for broader comparative statics results. What has not been considered formally is the effect of union activity on the international location of production and the pattern of international trade: that is, the simultaneous determination of the union wage and the set of products produced by union workers. By modeling the union as operating in an import-competing sector that produces a variety of heterogeneous goods, this paper explores the union's impact on the pattern of trade and, at the same time, the effect on union wages of shifting international patterns of production. In particular, if goods within the union sector differ in the intensity with which they require union labor, and if the (domestic) union wage premium is an important source of international cost differences, then only the least labor-intensive range of union-sector goods will be produced domestically, with goods of greatest labor intensity being produced abroad as a result of the relatively high cost of domestic union labor."

This paper studies the role of changes in borrower solvency in the initiation and propagation of the business cycle. We first develop a model of the process of financing real investment projects under asymmetric information, extending work by Robert Townsend. A major conclusion here is that when the entrepreneurs who borrow to finance projects are more solvent (have more ""collateral""), the deadweight agency costs of investment finance are lower. This model of investment finance is then embedded in a dynamic macroeconomic setting. We show that, first, since reductions in collateral in bad times increase the agency costs of borrowing, which in turn depress the demand for investment, the presence of these financial factors will tend to amplify swings in real output. Second, we find that autonomous factors which affect the collateral of borrowers (as in a ""debt-deflation"") can actually initiate cycles in output.",NA,1989,18,1,0,0,0,0,NA,2155,4,85,482,53,0.623529411764706,13.0885135135135,32.5522864864865,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,5.67058823529412,0.270588235294118,128,1.50588235294118,"the, of, a, net, worth",0.0269709543568465,Orley Ashenfelter,37.1493918918919,12.6736486486487,17.1297297297297,15.247664890283,11.4377027027027,18.5,1.78378378378378,0,0,NA;NA,NA;NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,2,Princeton U; U Wisconsin,Orley Ashenfelter,0,1,2,10,2,1,0,1,0,0,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0.25,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1980,535,"Bad economic times are typically associated with a high incidence of financial distress, as measured in increased defaults, bankruptcies, and business failures, and in the general deterioration of firm balance sheets. One might argue that these financial problems are merely passive reflections of adverse developments on the real side of the economy and therefore do not require special attention. But such a view is, in our opinion, unsupportable: First, it ignores the central allocative role played by the financial system in modern capitalist economies. Second, as a matter of theory, it appears impossible to explain why we have institutions such as noncontingent debt and bankruptcy (as opposed to Arrow-Debreu contingent contracts) without invoking asymmetric information or similar factors; such considerations having been admitted, however, there is a strong presumption that they will constrain the set of equilibria attainable by the economy. Thus, financial factors should indeed "" matter,"" ie, affect real outcomes. This paper develops a theoretical model in which financial conditions are not merely a ""sideshow"" to real activity but play a role in both the initiation and propagation of economic cycles."

This developing literature has already established a few interesting empirical regularities regarding the determinants of self-employment rates and the compensation of self-employed persons. For example, Blau (1987) finds that changes in tax laws and technology account for a large fraction of the observed increase in self-employment rates over the last two decades; Lazear and Moore (1984) document that the ageffearnings profiles of self-employed persons are substantially flatter than the ageffearnings profiles of salaried workers; and Evans and Leighton (1987) show that the transition rates into and out of self-employment are independent of age and labor market experience. It is also well known (Moore 1983; Borjas 1986) that there exist sizable differences in the characteristics of the self-employment sector across ethnicffracial groups. In particular, whites have larger self-employment rates and incomes than blacks or Hispanics. This fact is hard to interpret in the traditional framework of an employer discrimination model since self-employed persons have no reason to discriminate against themselves.'' This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of the differences in both self-employment rates and incomes across racial groups. Our maintained hypothesis is that these differences are generated by consumer discrimination, whereby white consumers dislike purchasing goods and services from blacks and other minorities (Becker 1971) ."

In the (limited) secondary market for LDC loans, bank loans to many countries --- particularly South American debtors---trade at substantial discounts.2 There is also evidence that anticipated LDC loan losses are reflected in the stock market values of major creditor banks.3 Given that the net external liabilities of all developing countries stood at over 950 billion dollars by the end of 1985 *, it is not surprising that the ""LDC debt crisis"" has attracted a great deal of attention.

We analyze this ides in the context of an imperfectly competitive economy with aggregate demand spillovers, and interpret the big push into industrialization as a move from a bad to a good equilibrium. We show that for two equilibria to exist, it must be the case that an industrializing firm raises the demand for products of other sectors through channels other than the contribution of its own profits to demand. For example, a firm paying high factory wages raises demand in other manufacturing sectors even if it loses money. In a similar vein, a firm investing today in order to produce at low cost tomorrow shifts income and hence demand for other goods into the future and so makes it more attractive for other firms also to invest today. Finally, an investing firm can benefit firms in other sectors if it uses a railroad or other shared infrastructure, and hence helps to defray the fixed cost of building the railroad.

The ongoing economic reform in China has attracted much attention in the West, in part because it represents a major social experiment in the design of institutions in which a > system emphasizing ideology and social sanctions has been replaced by a system relying more heavily on economic incentives. However, not all the increase in Chinese agricultural output can be attributed to systemic changes, because at the same time, the prices of agricultural outputs and the use of inputs such as chemical fertilizers were increased.^ This paper presents a method for decomposing the productivity increase in Chinese agriculture in the post-1978 period into that part attributable to price increases and that part which reflects the effects of strengthened individual incentives under the new institutional structure.

One such issue is the interaction between individual income uncertainty and tax policy. Since an individual's personal tax liability is typically contingent on his income, and since future income is uncertain, future taxes provide a form of insurance. This insurance effect of income taxes has normative implications regarding the desirability of the taxes (Varian, 1980) and positive implications regarding their impact on consumption and saving (Chan, 1983; Barsky, Mankiw, Zeldes, 1986).1 The purpose of this paper is to study the response of consumption to the timing of labor income taxes. We assume that individuals are infinitely lived, so that the taxes do not redistribute across generations. We also assume that labor supply is inelastic, so that the taxes are not distortionary. The failure of Ricardian equivalence in our model is fully attributable to the insurance effect of the income tax system. This failure of Ricardian equivalence, which was discussed by Barro (1974, p. 1115) and Tobin (1980, p. 59-60), was first analyzed explicitly by Chan using a two-period model. Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes argued that this insurance effect is likely to be quantitatively important; they examined multi-period examples but only through the use of computer simulations and under the assumption that income is independently distributed in each period. Here we allow individual income to follow a Markov process."

One is the dramatic multilateral reduction in tariffs negotiated under the GATT. The other is the move toward ""special"" protection that has occurred as the industrialized countries of the world have become more integrated and as volatility in trade flows has become a more important source of domestic disruption. The rise in special forms of protection is epitomized by the growing use of Voluntary Export Restraints (VERs), Orderly Market Arrangements (OMAs), and tariffs that are tailor made to suit the needs of particular sectors. These policy tools are typically utilized by countries to limit the rate of expansion of imports or exports from that which would occur absent intervention. The term ""managed trade"" is often invoked to characterize the current international trading environment, since it consists of a relatively low ""baseline"" or ""normal"" level of protection combined with the use of special protection to dampen underlying changes in trade flows. The low baseline level of protection sustained by countries suggests that a standard non-cooperative Nash equilibrium view is inadequate to explain existing levels of protection. One alternative way to view the existing trading environment is that it is the result of explicit agreements among countries. This approach to explaining levels of protection has been taken by Mayer (1981) and Riezman (1982)."

This central question of International economics has received surprisingly little attention In the theoretical literature over the years. Previous research on trade and growth has adopted the neoclassical framework to focus on factor accumulation in the open economy. (See the surveys by Findlay (1984) and Smith (1984)). This research largely neglects the effects of trade structure on rates of growth, however, addressing Instead the reverse causation from growth and accumulation to trade patterns.^ The direction that the research followed almost surely can be ascribed to the well-known property of the standard neoclassical growth model with diminishing returns to capital that (endogenous) growth in per capita Income dissipates In the long run. For this reason, the familiar models which Incorporate investment only in capital equipment seem ill-suited for analysis of long-run growth. The available evidence collected since the seminal work of Solow (1957) also leads one to look beyond capital accumulation for an explanation of growth."

Discussions of these observations appear, for example, in Lucas [1977], Long-Plosser [1983], Zarnowitz [1985].1 For the purpose of building models of the cycle, the task is to determine the features of preferences, endowments, technology and information, along with the institutional structure in which agents interact, that reproduce these two key observations.

The first is Kuznets' (1955) hypothesis on the relationship between economic growth and the distribution of income. On the basis of somewhat slender evidence, Kuznets (1955) cautiously offered the proposition that during the course of an economy's lifetime, income inequality rises during the childhood stage of development, tapers off during the juvenile stage, and finally declines as adulthood is reached. While far from being incontrovertible, other researchers have found evidence in support of this hypothesis. For example, Lindert and Williamson (1985) suggest that ""British experience since 1688 looks like an excellent advertisement for the Kuznets Curve, with income inequality rising across the Industrial Revolution, followed by a prolonged leveling in the last quarter of the nineteenth century"" (p. 344). Using cross-country data, Paukert (1973) finds evidence of intra-country income inequality rising and then declining with economic development.

According to his model, death rates fall and fertility rises when incomes exceed the equilibrium level, and the opposite occurs when incomes are less than that level.

This paper examines the hypothesis that the answer lies in differences in national public policies that affect the incentives that individuals have to accumulate capital in both its physical and human forms. Our analysis shows that these incentive effects can induce large differences in long-run growth rates. Since many of the key tax rates are difficult to measure, our procedure is an indirect one. We work within a calibrated, two-sector endogenous growth model, which has its origins in the microeconomic literature on human capital formation. We show that national taxation can substantially affect long-run growth rates. In particular, for small open economies with substantial capital mobility, national taxation can readily lead to ""development traps"" (in which countries stagnate or regress) or to ""growth miracles"" (in which countries shift from little growth to rapid expansion).

We show that national taxation can substantially affect long run growth rates.

In this paper, we show that a basic Schultzian model has the property that modest variations in tax rates are associated with large variations in long run growth rates. Our model follows leads provided by Uzawa [1965], Lucas [1988b], and Rebelo [1987].

One approach focuses on explaining the existence of unemployment as a fric-tional phenomenon, a byproduct of labor movements that respond to shifts in the demand for labor in different sectors of the economy. These demand-shifts are in turn the result of shocks to tastes or technology. Lucas and Prescott (1974) provide a theory, and Lilien (1982) applies it to some recent data on unemployment. The work of Long and Plosser (1983) is also a theory of sectoral labor relocation over time that abstracts from unemployment .1 But certain detailed features of mobility itself call for a richer theory. Two such features are (1) that workers tend to move mostly within sectors, not across sectors, and (2) that net labor mobility across sectors appears to be dwarfed by gross mobility -- most moves between sectors cancel out. The model of Jovanovic (1979), extended and estimated with micro data by Miller (1984) and Flinn (1986), was designed to explain such movements of labor. This second approach, however, says nothing about sectoral flows of labor. This paper merges these two views in one model, which is then estimated with data on individuals. This exercise allows us to measure the relative importance of each hypothesis. Moreover, it helps one avoid certain pitfalls."

In this model, the cost of external investment finance under the optimal contract is higher, the worse the borrower's balance sheet position (ie, the lower his net worth). In general equilibrium, the lower is borrower net worth, the further the number of projects initiated and the average quality of undertaken projects will be from the unconstrained first-best. We characterize a ""financially fragile"" situation as one in which balance sheets are so weak that the economy experiences substantial underinvestment, misallocation of investment resources, and possibly even a complete investment collapse.

While other components of the problem, such as the excess burden of the tax system, can presumably be recovered from empirical observations on the behavior of consumers, it is clear that estimating the social welfare function is not an easy task. Although there have been several attempts to recover the social welfare function using the revealed preferences of governments, (usually by assuming that governments are acting optimally according to a ""just"" principal of taxation, such as equal sacrifice), all of these methods require very strong assumptions which are unlikely to command wide support. This problem is especially disturbing for developing countries which rely heavily on commodity taxes as a major policy instrument for raising revenue and changing the income distribution. In most of these countries data is not available even for estimating the excess burden of the tax system. Therefore, it seems that the theory of optimal commodity taxation is not very helpful as an input into policy formulation in this context.

Though countries vary with respect to indexing for inflation and the relative tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income, the realization-based tax system sets capital gains taxation apart from other forms of taxation and is associated with a variety of economic distortions. The most frequently discussed problem arising from taxing capital gains upon realization is the ""lock-in"" effect, the desire to hold appreciated assets in order to defer taxes on gains already accrued. This effect leads investors to accept a lower rate of return before-tax than they would for new investments without such accrued gains, resulting in a distorted allocation of capital and inefficient portfolio selection. As an illustration of the lock-in effect, consider a simple two-period example in which an investor, having accrued a first-period gain, g, must decide whether to realize the gain and reinvest at the safe rate of return, i, or hold the asset for an additional, safe rate of return r."

Why could not both parties be made better off by moving to the final distribution of surplus immediately [ ] and sharing the benefits from increased production?"" A similar objection to developing a coherent theory of strikes is what Kennan (1986) calls the ""Hicks paradox"", namely: ""The main obstacle is that if one has a theory which predicts when a strike will occur and what the outcome will be, the parties can agree to this outcome in advance, and so avoid the costs of a strike. If they do this, the theory ceases to hold. [ ] If the parties are rational, it is difficult to see why they would fail to negotiate a Pareto optimal outcome."" This paradox has been resolved by resorting to informational imperfections, in particular asymmetric information. Indeed, it is often thought that there are no other possible culprits for these inefficiencies.^ Card (1988), for example, asserts that ""It has long been recognized that any consistent theoretical model of strikes must appeal to some form of imperfect information."

Yet the possibility of explaining aggregate economic phenomena based on these models has remained largely unexplored, primarily because of the technical difficulties involved. Since aggregate data do not look as discontinuous and lumpy as their microeconomic counterparts, in order to apply these models to macroeconomic data aggregation has to be modeled explicitly. This is hard to do when shocks are not purely idiosyncratic but also have a common (or, equivalent^, aggregate) component.

From the point of view of the family, neither debt nor social security alters available alternatives; both are therefore neutral. Thus, Barro's analysis identifies the strength of intergenerational altruism as a key factor in determining the effects of governEKnt bond issues and public pension programs.

Unfortunately, empirical analysis of gifts and bequests has proven problematic, and several critical questions remain unanswered. Economists disagree sharply about the quantitative importance of intergenerational transfers in the US. By some estimates, these transfers are responsible for approximately four-fifths of aggregate capital accumulation (see Kotlikoff and Summers [1981] and Kotlikoff [1988]); others place this figure below one-fourth (see Modigliani [1988]). There are also several competing schools of thought concerning transfer motives. Some argue that bequests are accidental, and result from precautionary responses to the absence of perfect insurance markets (Hurd [1987]). Others argue that bequests are intentional, and either reflect altruism (Tomes [1981]), or self-interested exchange with one's heirs (Bernheim, Shleifer and Summers [1985]). This paper presents new empirical evidence in support of the view that a significant fraction of total saving is motivated solely by the desire to leave bequests.

The activity of an employee of a traffic department whose sole duty is to ticket people for overtime parking exemplifies specific enforcement effort; so does, typically, investigative or prosecutorial effort made after the commission of a harmful act, for such effort by its nature concerns a single act.

There is a long tradition in trade theory of using models with Marshallian external effects to approach questions about increasing returns."

Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the decline in the fraction of insured unemployment is due to a decline in the takeup rate for benefits. Our estimates indicate that takeup rates declined abruptly between 1980 and 1982, leading to a 6 percentage point decline in the fraction of the unemployed who receive benefits.

Given their failure to grow over the past decade, there is now a widespread view that the HICs will never pay their debts in full; HIC bank loans trade in the secondary market at large discounts to par. 2 Recently, many countries have tried to alleviate their debt burdens either by repurchasing part of their debt at discount or by engaging in debt-equity swaps. Mexico, Chile, and Bolivia have already conducted debt repurchases, and Costa Rica is considering one. Debt-equity swaps have been tried to varying degrees by most of the major debtor countries. In a debt-equity swap, a foreign investor purchases debt on the secondary market and swaps it with the debtor country in exchange for direct foreign investment (that is, physical investment in the debtor country). Using swaps, Brazil may have cut its $120 billion foreign debt by as much as $6 billion in 198S alone. Chile has retired $4.2 billion through swaps and other mechanisms since the end of 1984, reducing its bank debt outstanding by more than 36 percent."

Rather, it affects the equilibrium amounts of owner-occupied and rental housing through an amalgam of policies such as: direct subsidies for low-income housing, deductions allowed under the personal income tax, the progressive personal rate structure, the relative taxation of other goods and assets, and the effect of monetary policy on interest rates. Of particular interest have been the effects of tax rules on the residential capital stock and tenure choice, that is, whether to own or rent. Personal tax rules favor owner housing by exempting the imputed net rental income. Tax rules also have favored rental housing to some extent through accelerated depreciation allowances.

In his classic 1956 article, Solov proposed that we begin the study of economic growth by assuming a standard neoclassical production function with decreasing returns to capital. Taking the rates of saving and population growth as exogenous, he showed that these two variables determine the steady-state level of Income per capita. Because saving and population growth rates vary across countries, different countries reach different steady states. Solow's model gives simple testable predictions about how these variables Influence the steady-state level of income. The higher the rate of saving, the richer the country. The higher the rate of population growth, the poorer the country. This paper argues that the predictions of the Solow model are, to a first approximation, consistent with the evidence. Examining recently available data for a large set of countries, we find that saving and population growth affect income in the direction that Solow predicted."

Though such models heavily influence the design of stabilization policies, their microfoundations are unclear and their sharp predictions are not always consistent with reality. In many countries, large cuts in government spending carried out as part of stabilization programs have led to expansions rather than contractions in economic activity. The absence of simple relationships between economic variables is often explained theoretically by the importance of expectations of future economic variables, including variables reflecting government policy. The idea that expectations of future policy changes are crucial in understanding seemingly counterintuitive macroeconomic dynamics has been explored before. It formed the basis of the now classic Sargent and Wallace paper on ""Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic"" (1981). More recently, Drazen and Helpman considered the effects of future anticipated fiscal changes meant to balance the budget on current inflation in a closed economy (1990) and the current account in an open economy (1987)."

Such a generalization is difficult to achieve because the multi-period consumption and portfolio choice problem is inherently nonlinear. A complete solution is obtained by combining the consumer's Euler equation with the intertemporal budget constraint, but the budget constraint is a nonlinear equation except in very special cases. In response to this difficulty Merton (1969, 1971, 1973) suggested reformulating the consumption and portfolio choice problem in continuous time. Doing this in effect linearizes by taking the decision interval as infinitely small, so that the model becomes linear over this interval. But this kind of linearity is only local, so it does not allow one easily to study longer-run aspects of intertemporal asset pricing theory. In this paper I take a different approach. Instead of assuming that the time interval is small, I assume that variation in the consumption-wealth ratio is small."

From a hypothetical social planner's point of view, such growth-oriented policy interventions are desirable whenever non-accumulated factors of production receive a positive, nondecreasing share of output in laisstz-faWe equilibrium: aggregate production must eventually increase linearly with accumulation for unceasing endogenous growth to be possible, hence positive remuneration of non-accumulated factors is inconsistent with first-best growth unless, as in Jones and Manuelli (1990), those factors are asymptotically unnecessary for production.

These prescriptions envisage a removal of controls on international asset trade, together with the removal of price and quantity rationing in domestic financial intermediation.1 While the theoretical analyses of the effects of controls on financial markets are clearly correct, their direct applications to policy have neglected the presence of important additional distortions in the economy.

This paper addresses the question of whether the behavior of cross-country income differentials over time, within a specified group of countries, might be affected by the removal of trade barriers. The analysis focuses on the evolutionary period of the European Economic Community, which is characterized by a specific timetable for the removal of trade barriers. This liberalization is shown to be strongly related to a significant income convergence that took place between the members of the Community. The evidence indicates that, until their trade became more liberalized, the income differentials between the countries of the EEC behaved very much like the income differentials between the industrialized countries today. After the onset of freer trade, the EEC countries achieved a reduction in income disparity that exhibited a marked similarity to the income convergence that occurred between the states of the US.

Because these agglomerated industries sometimes form the nuclei of cities it is convenient to refer to them as ""city-industries"".1 Contemporary economists interested in understanding the economics of city-industries have brought them under the heading of economic behavior that displays strategic complementarities: an agent is better off when other agents choose the same action that he does, rather than being worse off due to increased competition. Models of this type of behavior, admirably surveyed by Krugman [1991a], typically display multiple equilibria. This property is alleged in the recent work of Arthur [1990] and Krugman [1991b] to extend to city-industries, where the equilibria are locations in different regions of the same country or in different countries entirely. This same work attempts to demonstrate that ""history"" plays a large role in determining which equilibrium is actually chosen as the outcome. In Arthur's model, firms enter the industry in sequence. Each firm chooses a location on the basis of how many firms are there at the time of entry and a random vector that gives the firm's tastes for each possible location."

Indeed, some economists have argued that sectoral shifts were primarily responsible for the high levels of unemployment in the US in the 1970'a and 1980's, although the empirical evidence is by no means conclusive.2 The debate over the causes of unemployment persists in large part because it is difficult to distinguish empirically between unemployment associated with reallocation versus aggregate shocks.3 An increase in unemployment may reflect a contraction in aggregate demand that causes firms in all sectors to lay off workers temporarily."

Within such models the gains from asset trade, at least between industrial economies, typically are estimated to be quite modest under common specifications of individuals' preferences.1 The contribution of this paper is a simple model of global portfolio diversification in which a link between growth and financial openness emerges very naturally. Within this model, an economy that opens its asset markets to trade may experience an increase in expected consumption growth and a substantial rise in national welfare. Recent analyses of economic growth due to Romer (1986, 1990), Lucas (1988), and others explore mechanisms through which growth rates are endogenously determined by technological parameters, intertemporal preferences, market structures, and government policies. Extensions of these mechanisms to multi-economy frameworks, notably those contained in the treatise by Grossman and Helpman (1991), show that international trade in goods may accelerate or slow growth by shifting resources among alternative productive uses. The model set out below pursues this line of approach, showing that a pure expansion of opportunities for trade across states of nature may itself promote resource reallocations favorable to long-term economic growth."

The Becker-Murphy model follows Stigler and Becker (1977), Iannaccone (1986), Ryder and Heal (1973), Boyer (1978, 1983), and Spinnewyn (1981) by considering the interaction of past and current consumption in a rational model. The main feature of these models is that past consumption of some goods influences their current consumption by affecting the marginal utility of current and future consumption. Greater past consumption of harmfully addictive goods such as cigarettes stimulates current consumption by increasing the marginal utility of current consumption more than the present value of the marginal harm from future consumption. Therefore, past consumption is reinforcing for addictive goods."

For example, in a widely cited section, Abegglen and Stalk (1985) discuss the results of a survey in which Japanese managers rated market share the most important and stock price the least important of nine corporate objectives; US managers rated stock price second.2 Partially based on this type of evidence, Blinder (1991 and 1992) argues that Japanese managers maximize growth not profits; managers are able to pursue such a strategy because Japanese shareholders are unable to effectively discipline them.

Is a restaurant's markup on wine higher than on food because wine purchase signals a low demand elasticity for the whole meal or because it indicates a customer who is more costly to serve? Are grocery prices higher in poor neighborhoods than in wealthy ones because the cost of doing business is higher in poor areas or because buyers there are less mobile and less able to switch stores? Until recently, explanations that implied price discrimination often were discounted in markets with easy entry and firms earning normal returns in the long run. That response, however, has become less compelling with the presentation of numerous theoretical models in which price discrimination persists in the markets with multiple firms and even where firms earn zero economic profits.1 This paper analyzes price dispersion in the US airline industry in the context of the recent theoretical advances on competitive price discrimination. We focus on two objectives. First, we wish to quantify the extent of fare inequality in the airline industry and to describe patterns of price dispersion across markets.2 Second, we attempt to distinguish price dispersion due to discriminatory pricing from dispersion that results from variations in costs.3 To meet this objective, we examine the degree to which dis- 1 See Katz, 1984, Borenstein, 1985, and Holmes, 1989."

Tender offers or takeover bids are used when ownership of the target company is dispersed, with no shareholder holding a controlling interest. However, in many publicly traded corporations - both in the United States and (even more so) in other countries---a significant number of shares are concentrated in the hands of a controlling shareholder.1 In such cases, a buyer generally cannot obtain control unless the existing controller agrees to sell some or all of its shares to the buyer in a sale-of-control transaction."

In response, American firms now locate a significant and growing part of their foreign operations in tax havens, a group of countries with unusually low tax rates that has been extremely successful at attracting US business. From the standpoint of US tax policy, the widespread use of tax havens threatens the long-run sustainability of the US domestic tax base, since US multinational corporations may be able to shift some of their domestic income to low-tax offshore jurisdictions.

The rate of economic growth is determined by policy decisions which are shaped by the struggle for distributive shares: we endogenize government policy in a model of endogenous growth. We focus on the political conflict between individuals who derive their income from capital and those who derive their income from labor. The government has two decisions to make: (i) the rate at which capital is to be taxed; and (ii) the distribution of government expenditures between productive public investments and lump-sum transfers to workers. Holding the composition of public expenditure constant, the economy's growth rate is increasing in taxes on capital for ""small"" tax rates, and decreasing in taxes for ""large"" rates. Thus, a strictly positive tax rate on capital maximizes the economy's growth rate. On the other hand, holding the tax rate constant, growth is reduced by an increase in redistribution through transfers to workers, who supply labor inelastically."

Politicians also differ in their type. Good ones do no rent seeking, whereas bad ones finance their whims at taxpayers' expense. The problem for voters is to distinguish between the two. Consonant with the large literature on multi-agent incentive schemes (see, for example, Holmstrom (1982)), we show that it makes sense for voters to appraise their incumbents relative performance. Thus if states face correlated shocks affecting the costs of providing public services, then the information gleaned from another jurisdiction's taxes is valuable for their own jurisdictions."

In an attempt to test various theories of corporate dividend policy, Poterba and Summers [1983, 1984, 1985] assembled evidence on the relative market value of dividends and capital gains, the effect of dividend taxation on dividend payout, and the effect of dividend taxation on investment.

While the intertemporal approach has proved valuable for some facets of current-account analysis, many of the most fundamental problems in international finance cannot be seriously addressed in a setting of frictionless markets. Because the newer paradigm seems so ill-equipped to explain, for example, the effects of macroeconomic policies on output and exchange rates, empirical practitioners and policymakers have not yet been persuaded to abandon traditional aggregative Keynesian models. While the time-tested appeal of these models is undeniable, their lack of microfoundations presents problems at many levels. They ignore the intertemporal budget constraints central to any coherent picture of the current account and fiscal policy. They provide no clear description of how monetary policy affects production decisions."

The standard theoretical approach to the first question (as exemplified by Poterba (1984)) treats the housing market much like any other asset market. In this framework, house prices are forward looking and depend solely on such current and future ""fundamentals"" as user costs of capital, rents, and construction costs. However, this ""efficient markets"" approach to house price determination has encountered empirical difficulties. Case and Shiller (1989, 1990) present evidence that changes in house prices are forecastable, based on both past price changes and on such fundamental-based measures as rent-to-price and construction-cost-to-price ratios.1 Furthermore, there have been a number of dramatic boom-to-bust episodes at both the country and regional levels that appear to be difficult to explain---even retrospectively---with the standard model.2 Many observers have concluded from these sorts of data that house prices are in part driven by non-fundamental speculative phenomena such as fads or bubbles."

The temporal pattern of the depreciation in US nominal exchange rates following a positive monetary policy shock is inconsistent with simple overshooting models of the type considered by Dornbusch (1976).

Answering this question is central to developing satisfactory positive models of policy choice. Two broad, contrary perspectives can be discerned. The first characterizes the ""optimal"" policy from economic fundamentals and tests its predictions. Barro (1979) on the determination of government debt is a good example of this. This approach goes hand-in-hand with a political economy in which there are sufficient forces to ensure that optimal policies are indeed chosen. Wittman (1990) offers the purist statement of this view. Stigler (1971) and Becker (1983) have developed analyses of specific institutional contexts where the adoption of eiBcient policies is implied. The implications for the theory of public finance of such views are profound. For example, Ramsey's tax rules become a positive model of tax policy and Samuelson's rule for the provision of public goods, and its generalizations, becomes a prediction about what will be done in practice."

First, some brilliant theorists, say Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin (1991 translation), arrive at a new theory explaining international trade flows. After a while, someone comes along, say Wassily Leontief (1953). and tests the theory, finds that it doesn't do exceptionally well, and leaves matters generally mucked up. Later, someone else, say Edward Learner (1984, 1987). comes along and sets matters straight Maybe the theory works, maybe it does not, but by the time Learner was done, trade economists more or less knew why the theory did or did not find support in the data If those are the three steps in the life cycle of international trade theories, this paper is part of the second stage. This time around the theory tested is that of monopolistic competition and international trade. Instead of Heckscher and Ohlin, we have Elhanan Helpman and Paul Krugman. In this paper, we point out some puzzles and paradoxes. We do not provide many answers. At best, we pave the way for the third stage of the theory's life cycle.

Indeed, the relationship between the level of fertility and the level of income per capita is one of the strongest observable correlations in cross country data. The nature of the relationship between development and fertility has been studied from the perspective of the theory of growth as well as from the perspective of family economics. Growth theory has focussed on the negative effect of population growth on the level of capital per worker, and thus on the level of output per worker, whereas family economics has focussed on the changes in the economic environment that lead families to reduce fertility as countries become wealthier. This paper integrates these two strains of literature. It combines a model of the household's fertilityfflabor supply choice with a growth model in which the wages of men and women are endogenously determined. The main concern of the study is with how growth, via changes in relative factor prices, affects household decisions about the level of fertility and women's labor force participation, and how these decisions in turn feed back through the aggregate production mechanism to affect output growth. The analysis demonstrates that the effects of growth on fertility and of fertility on growth are mutually reenforcing."

2702,AER,1996-03-01,Productivity and the Density of Economic Activity,To explain the large differences in labor productivity across US states we estimate two models---one based on local geographical externalities and the other on the diversity of local intermediate services---where spatial density results in aggregate increasing returns.

In fluctuations theory, increasing returns due to externalities seem a promising way to explain the volatility of output --- the volatility is a puzzle in a convex neoclassical economy. In growth theory, aggregate increasing returns permits endogenous growth, also prohibited by neoclassical technology. And the recent upsurge of interest in the theory of regional and urban agglomeration rests on increasing returns associated with transportation and other coordination costs. Previous research (Hall [1990]) has suggested that increasing returns has an important role in explaining year-to-year movements in productivity. Caballero and Lyons [1992] argued that externalities are the most persuasive explanation of the observed extent of increasing returns. Earlier work has also pointed out the close connection between the study of the distribution of economic activity over time and over space (Hall [1991]). There is a substantial theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration effects relating to the size of cities. Our purpose in this paper is to look at the spatial dimension empirically within a framework where spatial density appears explicitly. The source of increasing returns studied here is density. By density we mean simply the intensity of labor and capital relative to 2 physical space. Density is high when there is a large amount of labor and capital per square foot."

One explanation frequently offered is that the 1981 US tax change greatly encouraged foreigners to invest in America.

The importance of this question, which has implications for macroeconomics as well as labor economics, has stimulated much earlier research and more than a little controversy. The purpose of this paper is to blend microeconomic data on wages with industrial data on profits to produce a new test of the competitive market hypothesis. The results of the study suggest that, contrary to the implications of competitive theory, US pay determination exhibits elements of rent-sharing. In a prominent early attack on traditional analysis, Sumner Slichter (1950) argued that a competitive model fails to explain the empirical evidence that apparently homogenous types of employee earn significantly different amounts in different industries. His data, drawn from the US manufacturing sector, showed that wages appeared to be positively correlated with various measures of the employer's 'ability to pay'. Slichier concluded that this correlation provides prima facie evidence against a conventional competitive model."

The distinctive claim of this emerging view--which is based on the research of a number of scholars and has been given am authoritative treatment by Eichengreen [1992]--is that the proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. A brief synopsis of the ""gold standard theory"" of the Depression is as follows: For a variety of reasons, including among others the desire of the Federal Reserve to curb the US stock market boom, monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920s--a contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard fiHamilton 1987, 1988; Temin 1989].1 What was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international ""scramble for gold""."

The speed at which relative prices move toward parity is important for theories of exchange rate determination and for open-economy macro models, almost all of which employ versions of PPP. Professional wisdom regarding the rate of convergence toward PPP has run the full gamut - from fairly high, to nearly zero, and now, back to positive but slow. In markets for goods and services there is little expectation that price disparities will instantly disappear as they do, for example, in financial markets, due to both explicit and implicit barriers to the flows of goods and services. We examine convergence in a context where many of these barriers are absent in order to quantitatively assess their importance in markets less integrated. Not long after Jacob Frenkel's seminal work (1978) which provided evidence supportive of convergence to PPP during a hyperinflation, many subsequent studies concluded a ""collapse of purchasing power parities.""1 In particular, these studies failed to reject the hypothesis that real exchange rates follow a random walk, which implies that any deviation from PPP is permanent."

A simple and elegant answer to this question comes from the mutual-fund separation theorem. This theorem, a building block of the most basic Capital Asset Pricing Model, is taught regularly to undergraduates and business students. According to the theorem, more risk averse investors should hold more of their portfolio in the riskless asset. The composition of risky assets, however, should be the same for all investors.

Together, these results are consistent with a search model in which owners ""constrained"" by large amounts of debt set a higher reservation price than ""unconstrained"" owners, accepting a lower probability of sale in exchange for a higher final sales price.",NA,1997,15,1,0,0,0,0,NA,216,4,106,623,69,0.650943396226415,15.164702970297,36.909395049505,R,0,0,0,0,1,1,5.87735849056604,0.283018867924528,178,1.67924528301887,"a, the, of, for, an",0.0256821829855538,Orley Ashenfelter,33.7844678217822,14.8198762376238,18.0207920792079,15.9031890086143,13.6567079207921,25.25,1.74257425742574,0,0,NA;NA,NA;NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,R31,0,0,0,NA,2,MIT; Columbia U,Orley Ashenfelter,0,1,2,5,2,1,0,1,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1990,913,"One of the distinctive and puzzling features of the housing market is the dramatic variation in real prices and sales volume over time.

42,ECA,1997-11-01,"Research, Patenting, and Technological Change","This paper develops a search-theoretic model of technological change that accounts for some puzzling trends in industrial research, patenting, and productivity growth. In the model, researchers sample from probability distributions of potential new production techniques. Past research generates a technological frontier representing the best techniques for producing each good in the economy. Technological breakthroughs, resulting in patents, become increasingly hard to find as the technological frontier advances. This explains why patenting has been roughly constant as research employment has risen sharply over the last forty years. Productivity is determined by the position of the technological frontier and hence by the stock of past research. If researchers sample from Pareto distributions, then productivity growth is proportional to the growth of the research stock. The Pareto specification accounts for why productivity growth has neither risen as research employment has grown nor fallen as patenting has failed to grow. The growth of research employment itself is driven, in equilibrium, by population growth. Calibrating the model's four parameters, the implied social return to research is over twenty percent.",English,1995-02-01,1997-03-01,65,6,1,1389,1419,NA,Samuel S.

One interpretation of these facts is that: (i) patentable inventions are becoming increasingly difficult to discover as the quality of techniques in use increases, (ii) inventions which are patented represent percentage improvements on techniques currently in use, and (iii) the size of the economy is growing, making patents increasingly valuable and justifying increased research efforts devoted to discovering them.

They do eliminate all nominal risk for the parties (by fully indexing the terms of the contracts to the price level) but they would be re-negotiated.

This for two reasons mainly. First, societies which choose to open their economies to international trade are likely to have a predilection in favor of free markets, and hence should also prefer smaller government."

One of the reasons for this Is that debt is a security with several characteristics: a debtor typically promises a creditor a noncontlngent payment stream; provides the creditor with the right to foreclose on the debtor's assets in a default state; and gives the creditor priority in bankruptcy. It is unclear whether all these characteristics are equally important, and whether they necessarily have to go together. In this paper we develop a model based on the second characteristic of debt --- the foreclosure right --- although our model implicitly has something to say about the other two characteristics as well. We consider an entrepreneur who needs funds from an investor (eg, a bank) to finance an investment project."

Becker (1965) and Mincer (1972) provide a systematic explanation of training investments and the associated wages of workers. This standard theory draws a crucial distinction between general and firm-specific training. General training will increase workers' wages in a range of employment opportunities, thus it is the worker who has to pay for general training. The firm should only pay for the firm-specific component of training which does not help the worker receive higher wages elsewhere. However, these predictions seem to be at odds with reality. In Germany, firms voluntarily offer apprenticeships to workers entering the labor market. Although general skills are an important component of these programs, much of the financial burden is borne by the firm (see Noll et al., 1983). The same is true in Japan where training and mentoring within companies is more important in many areas than formal schooling (eg there are no business schools in Japan)."

In this paper, we develop the theory of human capital when labor markets are imperfect. In contrast to the standard theory, labor market frictions imply that firms may be willing to invest in the general skills of their workers. In particular, if these frictions distort the structure of wages within the firm away from the competitive benchmark and to the benefit of unskilled workers, it will be profitable for the firm to provide workers with general skills. We find that contrary to conventional wisdom, for firms to pay for general skills, credit market problems are neither necessary nor sufficient.

When workers are more risk-averse, wages and unemployment decrease, and firms invest less. The reason is that risk-averse workers wish to avoid the risk of unemployment, and in response, the labor market offers its own version of insurance, an equilibrium with higher employment but lower wages. In a frictional market, when the unemployment risk of workers is reduced, the vacancy risk of firms increases, implying lower utilization of their ex ante investment.

Moreover, much of this trade involves goods with similar factor intensities. Explanations for these observations abound. Increasing returns to scale can account for trade in goods that are technologically alike but differentiated in the eyes of consumers (eg, Krugman, 1979). Oligopolistic competition can account for two-way trade in identical products under certain assumptions about oligopolistic conduct (eg, Brander, 1991). Small technological differences across countries can account for high volumes of trade in goods with similar factor intensities when factor endowment ratios are similar and there are more goods than factors (Davis, 1995).

Studies by psychologists have shown that mathematicians, physicists, and poets typically make their most important contributions at younger ages than do astronomers, biologists, and novelists.1 Psychologists consider these differences to be a function of the rates at which creative ideations can be produced and elaborated: they believe that both of these processes are more rapid in disciplines that deal with abstract conceptual entities than in those whose central ideas are more complex and concrete.2 The psychologists' empirical studies have been based on the assumption that the typical peak age for creativity in a profession is invariant over time, or changes only gradually.3 Yet economists have pointed to a variety of factors that can potentially produce rapid changes in the relationship between age and productivity in a given activity.4 This paper presents a case study of a profession in which a change in the criteria for quality produced a dramatic change in the age at which successful practitioners executed their best work.

Empirical regularities motivate theory in many areas of economics and data are routinely used to test theory. Many economic theories have been developed as measurement frameworks to suggest what data should be collected and how they should be interpreted.

We study how self-interest mediates these conflicting forces. When members' preferences differ, no person ever submits a report that allows perfect inference of his private information. Instead, equilibrium strategies are many-to-one mappings that transform continuous data into ordered ranks: voting procedures are the equilibrium methods of achieving a consensus in committees. Voting necessarily coarsens the transmission of information among members, but is necessary to control conflicts of interest. The degree of coarseness of the equilibrium voting procedure is determined by the extent of conflicting preferences.

3745,ECA,2001-01-01,Long-Term Debt and Optimal Policy in the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level,"The fiscal theory says that the price level is determined by the ratio of nominal debt to the present value of real primary surpluses. I analyze long-term debt and optimal policy in the fiscal theory. I find that the maturity structure of the debt matters. For example, it determines whether news of future deficits implies current inflation or future inflation. When long-term debt is present, the government can trade current inflation for future inflation by debt operations; this tradeoff is not present if the government rolls over short-term debt. The maturity structure of outstanding debt acts as a ""budget constraint"" determining which periods' price levels the government can affect by debt variation alone. In addition, debt policy---the expected pattern of future state-contingent debt sales, repurchases and redemptions---matters crucially for the effects of a debt operation. I solve for optimal debt policies to minimize the variance of inflation. I find cases in which long-term debt helps to stabilize inflation. I also find that the optimal policy produces time series that are similar to US surplus and debt time series. To understand the data, I must assume that debt policy offsets the inflationary impact of cyclical surplus shocks, rather than causing price level disturbances by policy-induced shocks. Shifting the objective from price level variance to inflation variance, the optimal policy produces much less volatile inflation at the cost of a unit root in the price level; this is consistent with the stabilization of US inflation after the gold standard was abandoned.",English,1998-10-01,2000-01-01,69,1,1,69,116,NA,John H.

3002,JPE,2001-12-01,Prospective Deficits and the Asian Currency Crisis,This paper argues that a principal cause of the 1997 Asian currency crisis was large prospective deficits associated with implicit bailout guarantees to failing banking systems.

Papers are modeled as varying along two quality dimensions: q and r. The former represents the clarity and importance of a paper's main ideas and the latter its craftsmanship and polish. Observed trends are regarded as increases in r-quality. A static equilibrium model in which an arbitrary social norm determines how q and r are weighted is developed and used to discuss comparative statics explanations for increases in r. The paper then analyzes a learning model in which referees (who have a biased view of the importance of their own work) try to learn the social norm from observing how their own papers are treated and the decisions editors make on papers they referee.

From this perspective, the cost of offering a pay-for-performance contract to a (risk averse) employee is that it imposes risk on his compensation, which causes higher wage costs. Consequently, when choosing higher performance pay, firms trade off the benefits of more effort against higher wage costs. The risk imposed on workers is increasing in the uncertainty of the environment so that the standard test of the tradeoff is to show that incentive pay is lower in more uncertain environments. Unfortunately, empirical research has not shown a convincing relationship between pay-for-performance and observed measures of uncertainty."

It is often viewed as important for investment decisions, and recent studies find that fluctuations in various measures of liquidity are correlated across stocks.1 This empirical study investigates whether market-wide liquidity is indeed priced.

Not necessarily. By postponing tax payments until death, estate taxation may act like social security by reducing the present value of lifetime tax liability the longer one lives. To the extent that people subject to the estate tax do not face actuarially fair insurance markets,2 it may make perfect sense to raise at least part of tax revenue in the form of an estate tax. The key insight is that estate taxation can bring about a transfer from the (ex-post) short-living to long-living individuals. Assuming a risk-neutral government (or, simply, no aggregate mortality risk), the government may be able to transfer resources between different states of the world at actuarially fair rates without any loss in revenue (and thus without increasing the present value of taxes paid by a given individual)."

Thus, Summers and Heston, in version 5.6 of their popular international data set, cite the fact that ""it is widely felt that fiChina's] growth rates are too high"" and, accordingly, arbitrarily lower the reported growth of consumption and investment during the 1980-1993 period by 30 percent and 40 percent, respectively fiSummers and Heston 1994].

What is particularly interesting about Texas is that alcohol regulations at the local level are determined directly by the citizens.1 A citizen wishing to change regulations in his community can get the change voted on in a referendum. Such referenda are commonplace, with over 500 elections between 1976 and 1996. These liquor referenda appear a promising vehicle for understanding voter turnout. First, turnout varies widely.

I study a world economy with two sectors, one where output is produced by teams and another where individuals can work alone.

Among the fixed costs most often cited are ""lemons costs.""1 These costs arise because adverse selection in the secondary market reduces the price of a durable, and thereby discourages trade (Akerlof [1970]). The size of this cost depends on the distribution of quality in the secondary market, and this distribution depends on the sales decisions of consumers. In spite of the obvious endogeneity of such costs, models of durables typically assume that the fixed costs of adjustment are exogenous. The model that we present is standard except that the adjustment cost arises endogenously from adverse selection in the secondary market. In the model, consumers hold cars of various qualities. Only the owner of a car knows its true quality. There is also a parameter that characterizes the quality of the match between the car and its owner. A good match is more desirable than a poor match. Consumers may sell cars either because the quality is low or because the car is not a good match for their current needs."

For that reason the nature of the financial arrangements between investors and entrepreneurs has important consequences for the growth of firms. One important issue in financial con- tracting is enforceability, that is, the ability of each side to repudiate the contract. This is especially important because projects often involve specific entrepreneurial expertise and might be worth less to investors without the services of managers who initiated them. At the same time the development of such projects may provide managers with experience that is extremely valuable for starting new projects. Contractual arrangements that are motivated by limited enforceability are most likely to be important for firms that are small, young and invest in assets that cannot be used as collateral. Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (1997) have shown that these considerations can help to explain some of the growth characteristics of small and young firms."

This point was originally made by Alchian and Allen, and was described by them more colorfully as ""shipping the good apples out"". That is, international transportation costs lead firms to ship high quality goods abroad while holding lower quality goods for domestic consumption. Despite considerable theoretical attention, this classical proposition has not previously been examined empirically. This paper tests the Alchian Allen conjecture using a model of trade in quality differentiated goods, and extensive data on traded goods' prices, quantities and shipping costs. We begin by modeling consumer demands for traded goods of varying quality in the presence of shipping costs. In its traditional form, the Alchian Allen hypothesis concerns the relative quality of goods shipped internationally versus domestically."

One commonly noted bias in reporting is ideological. During President Clinton's impeachment trial, the right-leaning media supported impeachment, arguing that even a small lie in a civil deposition constitutes a major crime. The left-leaning media, in contrast, saw the trial as a witch-hunt, treating the very same violations condemned by the conservative press as trivial. Another, perhaps less commonly noted, bias is not ideological at all, but rather results from the need to tell a memorable story. Thus both the conservative and the liberal media condemned Wen Ho Lee as a Chinese spy, without entertaining the possibility that he was scape-goated by dishonest officials. The media were surely biased, and probably wrong. In this paper, we draw a sharp analytical distinction between these two kinds of biased reporting. We call the traditional left or right bias ideology, and the less traditional bias - one based on the need to tell a story - spin. We see ideology as coming directly from the preferences of either editors or reporters. For example, left wing newspapers may simply prefer to report news one way."

To this end, we formulate and estimate a dynamic, general equilibrium model which incorporates staggered wage and price contracts. We use our model to investigate what mix of frictions can account for the evidence of inertia and persistence. For this exercise to be well defined, we must characterize inertia and persistence precisely. We do so using estimates of the dynamic response of inflation and aggregate variables to a monetary policy shock. With this characterization, the question that we ask reduces to: 'Can models with moderate degrees of nominal rigidities generate inertial inflation and persistent output movements in response to a monetary policy shock?'1 Our answer to this question is, 'yes'. The model that we construct has two key features. First, it embeds Calvo style nominal price and wage contracts."

3471,QJE,2005-05-01,A Model of Add-on Pricing,"This paper examines competitive price discrimination with horizontal and vertical taste differences. Consumers with higher valuations for quality are assumed to have stronger brand preferences. Two models are considered: a standard competitive price discrimination model in which consumers observe all prices; and an ""add-on pricing"" game in which add-on prices are naturally unobserved and firms may advertise a base good at a low price in hopes of selling add-ons at high unadvertised prices. In the standard game price discrimination is self-reinforcing: the model sometimes has both equilibria in which the firms practice price discrimination and equilibria in which they do not. The analysis of the add-on pricing game focuses on the Chicago-school argument that profits earned on add-ons will be competed away via lower prices for advertised goods. A conclusion is that add-on practices can raise equilibrium profits by creating an adverse selection problem that makes price-cutting unappealing. Although profitable when jointly adopted, using add-on pricing is not individually rational in a simple extension with endogenous advertising practices and costless advertising. Several models that could account for add-on pricing are discussed.",English,NA,NA,120,2,1,585,637,NA,Glenn Ellison,1996,Male,English,NA,MIT; NBER,L11; L13; M37,w9721,2003-05-01,A Model of Add-on Pricing,"This paper examines a competitive model of add-on pricing, the practice of advertising low prices for one good in hopes of selling additional products (or a higher quality product) to consumers at a high price at the point of sale.

The quoted price for a hotel room may not include phone calls, in-room movies, minibar items, dry cleaning, etc. Electronics stores offer extended warranties and accessories. Car rental agencies offer insurance and prepaid gasoline. New car dealers hope to service cars they sell. Add-ons need not be a separate goods. For example, a high quality mattress can be thought of as a bundle containing a low quality mattress and an add-on of additional quality. Once one starts to think broadly about add-on pricing, it can be challenge to think of a business where the practice is absent. Although many firms earn a substantial portion of their revenue from add-ons, it is not clear that we should care.1 The classic Chicago school argument would be that profits earned on add-ons will be competed away in the form of lower prices for the base good. Two formalizations of this argument can be found in the literature. Lal and Matutes (1994) develops a model of loss-leader pricing in which the Chicago view is true to an extreme – every consumer purchases the same bundle at the same price regardless of whether the prices of add-ons are or are not advertised. Verboven (1999) analyzes a model of add-on pricing with different assumptions about preferences in which add-on pricing again has no effect on profits. This paper, in contrast, argues that add-on pricing is important."

4363,QJE,2005-02-01,The Political Economy of Hatred,"This paper develops a model of the interaction between the supply of hate-creating stories from politicians and the willingness of voters to listen to hatred. Hatred is fostered with stories of an out-group's crimes, but the impact of these stories comes from repetition not truth. Hate-creating stories are supplied by politicians when such actions help to discredit opponents whose policies benefit an out-group. Egalitarians foment hatred against rich minorities; opponents of re-distribution build hatred against poor minorities. Hatred relies on people accepting, rather than investigating, hate-creating stories. Hatred declines when there is private incentive to learn the truth. Increased economic interactions with a minority group may provide that incentive. This framework is used to illuminate the evolution of anti-Black hatred in the United States South, episodes of anti-Semitism in Europe, and the recent surge of anti-Americanism in the Arab world.",English,NA,NA,120,1,1,45,86,NA,Edward L. Glaeser,1484,Male,English,NA,Harvard U; NBER,D72; D74,w9171,2002-09-01,The Political Economy of Hatred,"What determines the intensity and objects of hatred? Hatred forms when people believe that out-groups are responsible for past and future crimes, but the reality of past crimes has little to do with the level of hatred. Instead, hatred is the result of an equilibrium where politicians supply stories of past atrocities in order to discredit the opposition and consumers listen to them. The supply of hatred is a function of the degree to which minorities gain or lose from particular party platforms, and as such, groups that are particularly poor or rich are likely to be hated.

Before 1945, Franco-German hatred was a regular feature of European life. It is no longer. Racial discrimination may be a pervasive feature of American society, but actual hatred of African-Americans was ubiquitous only in the South and only between 1865 and 1970.

In particular, being open-end exposes arbitrageurs to the risk of large withdrawals if they perform poorly in the short run.2 This risk in turn makes it dangerous for them to put on trades that are attractive in a long-run sense, but where convergence to fundamentals is unlikely to be either smooth or rapid—a point that has been made by Shleifer and Vishny (1997)."

In this paper, we argue that tyranny of the majority imparts a protectionist bias to democratic politics.

As a consequence, the supply of regulation is limited by the extent of the market. We test three implications of this model. First, jurisdictions with larger populations affected by a given regulation are more likely to have it. Second, jurisdictions with lower incremental fixed costs of introducing and administering new regulations should regulate more. This implies that regulation spreads from higher to lower population jurisdictions, and that jurisdictions that build up transferable regulatory capabilities should regulate more intensely. Consistent with the model, we find that higher population US states have more pages of legislation and adopt particular laws earlier in their history than do smaller states.

At the same time, for young doctors who have just com- pleted four years of medical school, salaries are low, averaging around $40,000 per year, and compressed, and work hours are long, 80 hours a week in many programs.2 While salary differentials are only one way in which residency programs might com- pete, the compression of salaries within programs, within specialties, and across fields is remarkable, compared to the variation in pay among more senior doctors."

Compare an allocation with two agents, each consuming one unit of a lone consumption good, with an allocation where only one agent is born, but consumes two units of the consumption good. Is one allocation Pareto-superior to the other? Pareto- efficiency would involve a comparison, for each person, of the two alloca- tions."

If not, what government policies can improve the allocation of risk? These are classic questions of economic theory. One celebrated answer comes from the Arrow-Debreu theory of general equilibrium. This theory teaches that under certain conditions--in particular, if contingent-claims markets are complete--the allocation of risk will be Pareto efficient. In other words, with complete markets, society can let the invisible hand allocate risk. This paper explores a deviation from Arrow-Debreu theory that arises from a simple fact that not everyone is born at the beginning of time. In an overlapping-generations economy, markets must be incomplete, because a person cannot engage in risk-sharing trades with those who are not yet born. The risks associated with holding capital assets, for instance, can be shared with others alive at the same time, but they cannot be shared with future generations. As a result, the allocation of risk need not be efficient, and government policy may be able to make Pareto improvements."

Lower capital ratios in these countries are instead attributable to lower endowments of complementary factors and lower efficiency, as well as to lower prices of output goods relative to capital.

We approach this by studying a risk-averse worker in a sequential job search setting (McCall, 1970). Our main theoretical insight is that the worker's after-tax reservation wage---the difference between her reservation wage and the tax needed to fund the unemployment insurance system--- encodes all of the relevant information about her welfare. This is true regardless of whether workers are able to borrow and lend to smooth their consumption, or whether they must live hand-to-mouth. Intuitively, the after-tax reservation wage tells us the take-home pay required to make a worker indifferent between working and remaining unemployed. Since take-home pay translates directly into consumption, it is a valid measure of the worker's utility. Given the simplicity of the argument, it should not be surprising that this insight turns out to be robust to many variations of our basic model. To prove this result, we develop a formal dynamic model of job search with risk-aversion. Workers draw wages from a known distribution and accepted jobs last for a fixed amount of time. In order to abstract from wealth effects, we assume workers have constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) preferences."

The net result is a simple relation for inﬂation that is much in the spirit of a traditional Phillips curve: Inﬂation depends on a measure of real activity as well as expectations of the future. In addition to its forward-looking nature, this relationship also differs from the traditional Phillips curve in that all the coefficients are explicit functions of the primitives of the model.

Becker's analysis focused on the relationship between racial prejudice among whites and discrimination against racial minorities in a competitive model. In contrast to much of the contemporaneous literature, Becker formalized the definition of racial preferences, depicting them as an aversion to cross-racial interaction. In a series of models, he analyzed the effect of the possession of such preferences among customers, co-workers and employers on black relative wages. Since the publication of Becker's work, discrimination has been one of the most intensely studied topics in economics; theorists have posited different explanations for racial wage gaps including many which do not depend on racial animus, and there have been hundreds of empirical studies devoted to measuring and attempting to explain wage differences. Yet, curiously, in the massive and growing discrimination literature, there is no paper of which we are aware that tests the sharp, yet subtle predictions of Becker's original prejudice model about the relationship between racial wage gaps and prejudice. In this paper, we attempt to address this omission. In the short-run version of Becker's employer discrimination model, racial prejudice causes some employers to regard black workers as more expensive than they truly are. Market pressures cause blacks to be hired by the least prejudiced employers in the market and to sort away from those with the highest levels of prejudice. In equilibrium, Becker shows that black relative wages are determined by the most prejudiced employer with whom they come into contact---the marginal discriminator. Racial wage gaps, in Becker's formulation, are determined by the prejudice of this marginal person, and not by the average level of prejudice among all employers. More generally, given the sorting mechanism described above, and since blacks constitute a relatively small share of the labor force in almost every labor market, wage gaps will generally be determined by variation in the level of prejudice of those in the lower tail of the prejudice distribution; how prejudiced the most prejudiced employers are should not matter at all for wages in Becker's framework."

The second is sectoral comovement: output, employment, and investment tend to rise and fall together in different sectors of the economy. Lucas (1977) argues that these comovement properties reflect the central role that aggregate shocks play in driving business fluctuations. However, it is surprisingly difficult to generate both aggregate and sectoral comovement, even in models driven by aggregate shocks. Barro and King (1984) show that the one-sector growth model generates aggregate comovement only in the presence of contemporaneous shocks to total factor productivity (TFP)."

If the marginal investor is subject to taxes, then asset valuations and asset returns should reﬂect this tax burden in equilibrium. In particular, to compensate taxable investors for their tax burden, before-tax asset returns should be higher and asset valuations should be lower in periods of relatively high tax rates. On the other hand, taxes should not affect asset valuations if the marginal investor is effectively tax-exempt, as first discussed by Miller and Scholes (1978).

As a result, there is substantial interest from both developing country governments and international institutions in understanding the forces that drive corrupt behavior. Most theoretical and empirical work on corruption focuses on the individual corrupt transaction  potentially corrupt officials weigh the benefits from corruption against the expected punishments if they are caught, and choose accordingly. However, the level of corruption may also be influenced by market forces. In this view, first articulated by Shleifer and Vishny (1993), corrupt officials behave like profit maximizing firms, and the level of corruption is determined by the structure of the 'market' for bribes, the elasticity of demand for the officials' services, and the degree to which corrupt officials can coordinate with one another in setting prices. This paper takes the market forces view of corruption seriously, and examines the degree to which standard pricing theories from industrial organization are consistent with actual patterns of bribes and extortion payments. We study these questions in the context of bribes paid by truck drivers on their trips to and from the Indonesian province of Aceh. Truck drivers in Aceh make a variety of illegal payments, including payments to police and military officers to avoid harassment at checkpoints along the roads, payments at weigh stations to avoid fines for driving overweight, and protection payments to criminal organizations and the police. To investigate these payments, we designed a study in which enumerators accompanied truck drivers along their regular routes to and from Aceh. From November 2005 to July 2006, enumerators accompanied drivers on a total of 304 trips to and from Aceh, and directly observed more than 6,000 illegal payments along the routes.

For the relationship to work out the parties need to cooperate in ways that cannot be specified in an initial contract. The buyer and seller face the following trade-off. On the one hand they can write a flexible contract that attempts to index the terms of trade  price  to the state of the world. However, to the extent that value and cost are not objective, such a contract will lead to argument, aggrievement and shading; this in turn creates deadweight losses."

I find robust evidence that toll rates increase following the adoption of electronic toll collection. My estimates suggest that, in steady state, toll rates are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without electronic toll collection. Consistent with the hypothesis that decreased tax salience is responsible for the increase in toll rates, I also find evidence that the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the actual toll declines (in absolute value) following the adoption of electronic toll collection.

While some of this concentration is explained by the presence of natural advantages that constrain specific productions to specific locations, Ellison and Glaeser (1999) and others argue that natural advantages alone cannot account for the observed degree of agglomeration. Spatial concentration is particularly remarkable for industries that produce nationally traded goods, because the areas where economic activity is concentrated are typically characterized by high costs of labor and land. Since at least Marshall (1890), economists have speculated that this concentration of economic activity may be explained by cost or productivity advantages enjoyed by firms when they locate near other firms. The list of potential sources of these agglomerations advantages includes: cheaper and faster supply of intermediate goods and services; proximity to workers or consumers; better quality of the worker-firm match in thicker labor markets; lower risk of unemployment for workers and lower risk of unfilled vacancies for firms following idiosyncratic shocks; and knowledge spillovers.1 The possibility of documenting that productivity advantages through agglomeration are real is tantalizing, because it could provide insights into a series of important questions. Why are firms that produce nationally traded goods willing to locate in cities like New York, San Francisco or London, characterized by extraordinary production costs? In general, why do cities exist and what explains their historical development? Why do income differences persist across regions and countries? Beside its obvious interest for urban and growth economists, the existence of agglomeration spillovers has tremendous practical relevance. Increasingly, local governments compete by offering substantial subsidies to industrial plants to locate within their jurisdictions. The main economic rationale for these incentives depends on whether the attraction of new businesses generates some form of agglomeration externalities. In the absence of positive externalities, it is difficult to justify the use of taxpayer money for subsidies based on efficiency grounds. The optimal magnitude of these incentives depends on the magnitude of agglomerations spillovers, if they exist.2 Despite their enormous theoretical and practical relevance, the existence and exact magnitude of agglomeration spillovers are considered open questions by many. To date, there are two primary approaches for testing for spillovers. The first tests for an unequal distribution of firms across the country. These 'dartboard' style tests reveal that firms are spread unevenly across the country and that coagglomeration rates are higher between industries that are economically similar (Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr, 2007). This approach is based on equilibrium location decisions and does not provide a direct measure of spillovers."

A second influential hypothesis in the discipline has been the notion that households' consumption behavior is directly affected by their neighbors, via competitive or imitative processes; see for example Leibenstein (1950), Pollak (1976), Bagwell and Bernheim (1996), and Becker and Murphy (2001). Finally, a fundamental prediction of consumer theory is the notion that households who receive extramarginal in-kind transfers should, if possible, attempt to undo those transfers by converting them to cash (eg Moffitt 1984, 1989). To date, empirical testing of all the above hypotheses has yielded less-than-definitive results, due in part to the lack of credibly exogenous variation in either a household's own income, or in either the income or consumption of its neighbors. Recently, however, progress on testing the PIH has been made by using the random timing of income tax rebates (Agarwal, Liu and Souleles 2007). Regarding social effects, a number of recent studies have used plausibly exogenous variation to study social and neighborhood effects, such as Sacerdote's (2001) study of (randomly assigned) college room mates, and social experiments such as Moving to Opportunity which randomly assign households to neighborhoods (Katz et al. 2001, Kling et al. 2005, Ludwig et al. 2001). To our knowledge however, none of these newer studies of social effects focus specifically on household consumption. We are aware of no experimental tests of simple models of transfers in kind. In this paper we contribute to all the above research questions using data from the Dutch Postcode Lottery (PCL). Each week, this lottery allocates a prize to participants in a randomly chosen postcode (containing 19 households on average). About one third of the Dutch population participates in the lottery. A participant wins 12,500 per ticket. In addition, one of the participants wins a BMW. From an experimental design perspective, the lottery provides PCL participants in the winning code with an unexpected temporary income shock equal on average to about eight months of income, while leaving all other households' incomes unchanged."

However, clear identification of a price bubble is challenging due to the difficulty of measuring an asset's fundamental value. There is an open debate about whether each historical episode constitutes a bubble. For example, Garber (2000) proposes market fundamental explanations for three famous bubbles, the Dutch tulip mania (1634-37), the Mississippi bubble (1719-20) and the closely connected South Sea bubble (1720). Pastor and Veronesi (2006) challenge the existence of an Internet bubble in the late 1990s. The difficulty of measuring asset fundamentals makes it even more challenging to analyze economic mechanisms that drive up price bubbles. Instead, the academic literature heavily relies on laboratory settings to study asset bubbles. In this paper, we use a unique data sample from China's warrants market to study asset price bubbles. In 2005-08, several Chinese companies issued put warrants with long maturities ranging from 9 months to 2 years. These warrants give their holders the right to sell the issuing companies' stocks at predetermined strike prices during a pre-specified exercise period. The dramatic stock market runup in China between 2005 and 2007 pushed most of these put warrants so deep out of the money that they were certain to expire worthless. However, they had become targets of frenzied speculation, which generated a spectacular bubble as dramatic as, if not more than, any historical bubble episode. For each warrant, billions of Yuan traded with an average daily turnover rate close to 300%, and at substantially inflated prices. Several features make these warrants particularly appealing for analyzing bubbles: First, we can reliably measure the warrants' fundamental values to be zero using the underlying stock prices; second, the publicly observable stock prices also make the zero warrant fundamentals observable to all market participants; and third, these warrants have a predetermined finite maturity. These features so far are available only in laboratory environments."
8344,ECA,2011-07-01,Risk Sharing in Private Information Models with Asset Accumulation: Explaining the Excess Smoothness of Consumption,"We study testable implications for the dynamics of consumption and income of models in which first-best allocations are not achieved because of a moral hazard problem with hidden saving. We show that in this environment, agents typically achieve more insurance than that obtained under self-insurance with a single asset. Consumption allocations exhibit ""excess smoothness"", as found and defined by Campbell and Deaton (1989). We argue that excess smoothness, in this context, is equivalent to a violation of the intertemporal budget constraint considered in a Bewley economy (with a single asset). We also show parameterizations of our model in which we can obtain a closed-form solution for the efficient insurance contract and where the excess smoothness parameter has a structural interpretation in terms of the severity of the moral hazard problem. We present tests of excess smoothness, applied to UK microdata and constructed using techniques proposed by Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) to test the intertemporal budget constraint. Our theoretical model leads us to interpret them as tests of the market structure faced by economic agents. We also construct a test based on the dynamics of the cross-sectional variances of consumption and income that is, in a precise sense, complementary to that based on Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) and that allows us to estimate the same structural parameter.

Friedman and Schwartz had the Monetary History of the US and UK. The central story for the new-Keynesian Taylor rule is that U. S. inflation was stabilized in the early 1980s, by a change from a 'passive' policy in which interest rates did not respond suffciently to inflation, to an 'active' policy in which they did so. Most famously, Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000) run regressions of interest rates on inflation and output. They find inflation coeffcients below one up to 1980, and above one since then.

In standard new-Keynesian models the government-spending multiplier can be somewhat above or below one depending on the exact specification of agent's preferences (see Gali, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007) and Monacelli and Perotti (2008)). In frictionless real-business-cycle models this multiplier is typically less than one (see eg Aiyagari, Christiano, and Eichenbaum (1992), Baxter and King (1993), Burnside, Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004), Ramey and Shapiro (1998), and Ramey (2008)).

On the other hand, the stance of the rather limited academic literature on confidence is far more ambiguous. The judgments range from the conclusion that confidence measures have an important role both in prediction and understanding the cause of business cycles, to the view that they contain important information but have little role in the assignment of causality, to the verdict that they have no value even in forecasting. There are, broadly speaking, two contrasting approaches to the role of confidence in macroeconomics. The first, which we will refer to as the 'animal spirits' view, posits autonomous fluctuations in beliefs and consumption that in turn have causal effects on economic activity. In the proceedings of a symposium on the causes of the 1990-1991 recession, both Hall (1993) and Blanchard (1993) regard exogenous movements in consumption as a cause of business cycles.1 Indeed, Blanchard proposes that the cause of the recession was a powerful, long-lasting negative consumption shock associated with an exogenous shift in pessimism that had a causal effect on consumption and overall aggregate demand. While not fully pursuing the idea in his brief paper, Blanchard proposes that one might be able to test this hypothesis on the basis of the observation that such an exogenous shift in pessimism ought to have only temporary effects on consumption.2 The second view of confidence  what we will call the 'information view'  suggests that a relationship between innovations in measures of consumer confidence and subsequent macroeconomic activity arises because confidence measures contain fundamental information about the current and future states of the economy. For example, Cochrane (1994b) proposes that consumption surprises proxy for news that consumers receive about future productivity that does not otherwise show up in econometricians' information sets. His attempt to reconcile VAR evidence with theory closely anticipates the 'news approach to business cycles' of Beaudry and Portier (2004, 2006). They analyze models where agents become aware of changes in future productivity orthogonal to current productivity, and argue that stock price innovations proxy for future technological improvement not reflected in current technology. The 'information view' of confidence supposes that confidence innovations might contain similar information. 1 In an interesting but almost forgotten early contribution, Hall (1986)  partially repudiating Hall (1978)  argues that an important fraction of the random walk in consumption comes not from the expectational surprise in the Euler equation but from a second disturbance that he has more recently referred to as 'spontaneous consumption'."

While Keynes' specific prediction was far from the mark, he got the general direction of change correct. Thus asking what people would do with their extra time if they were confronted with a large decline in market hours remains an interesting question. The difficulty in answering this question is that changes in individuals' time allocations arise from the interaction of changes in the technology of the production of Beckerian commodities with consumers' preferences for those commodities."

More productive firms are more likely to export, have higher export revenues, and enter more markets.1 These patterns are consistent with early heterogeneous firm models that emphasize efficiency sorting across firms: more productive firms become more successful exporters because they have lower marginal costs and charge lower prices.2 Recent evidence, however, suggests that larger exporters pay higher wages and are more skill and capital intensive. Moreover, exporters charge higher prices than non-exporters, and plant size is positively correlated with output and input prices.3 To rationalize these facts while retaining the advantages of the efficiency sorting framework, recent models have introduced quality differentiation across firms: more productive firms have superior export performance because they sell higher quality goods at higher prices.4 1 See for example Clerides, Lach and Tybout (1998), Aw, Chung and Roberts (2000), Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2004, 2008) and Bernard, Jensen and Schott (2009), and Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott (2007) for a survey of the literature. 2 See Melitz (2003), Bernard, Eaton, Jensen and Kortum (2003) and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). 3 See Bernard and Jensen (1995), Verhoogen (2008), Kugler and Verhoogen (2008), Hallak and Sivadasan (2008) and Iacovone and Javorcik (2008). 4 See Johnson (2007), Baldwin and Harrigan (2007), Verhoogen (2008), Kugler and Verhoogen (2008), Hallak and Sivadasan (2008) and Kneller and Yu (2008). This paper examines the variation in free on board (fob) export prices across firms, products and destinations using detailed proprietary data on the universe of Chinese trading firms. We establish five stylized facts which allow us to distinguish between alternative heterogeneous firm models. Our results are consistent with quality sorting across firms and firms adjusting both quality and mark-ups across destinations in response to market toughness. Since existing models assume either no quality differentiation across firms or no quality differentiation within a firm across trade partners, however, they are unable to explain the patterns in the data. Our findings thus point to previously unexplored dimensions of firm heterogeneity and adjustments on the quality margin within firms across destinations. First, we establish that, among exporters selling in a given destination-product market, firms charging higher fob prices earn bigger revenues. When we look at the variation in worldwide exports across firms trading a given product, we also find a positive correlation between firms' average export price, worldwide sales and number of export destinations."

A simple alternative is for a seller to ask buyers to make offers sequentially. If it is costly for buyers to participate, the sequential mechanism will tend to be more efficient than the simultaneous auction because later potential buyers can condition their participation decisions on earlier bids. However, the sequential mechanism's greater efficiency may not produce higher revenues because while the possibility of deterring later potential entrants can lead early bidders to bid aggressively, the fact that later firms might be deterred will tend to reduce revenues. The relative revenue performance of the mechanisms will therefore depend on whether the threat of potential future competition, which can raise bids in the sequential mechanism, is more valuable to the seller than actual competition, which will tend to be greater in the simultaneous auction."

Given that prisons are expensive to build and run, and often involve cruel treatment of fellow citizens, possibly contributing to the conversion of inmates into =hardened criminals, it is unsurprising that alternatives to imprisonment have been tried out. One of the more intriguing experiments in this area is the substitution of incarceration for electronic monitoring (EM).1 =Tagging, as it is also sometimes called, involves fitting offenders with an electronic device (typically on the ankle) that can be monitored remotely by employees of a correctional facility who can verify whether the individual is violating a set of pre-established conditions. The most common of these conditions is to stay at home, although in some cases a provision for attending work or school is included. By 2007, more than 250,000 people in the US and Europe alone had been =treated with electronic monitoring, in spite of the obvious complexity of a full cost-benefit analysis. In this paper we seek to contribute to an evaluation of electronic monitoring (and more broadly to the debate about the effectiveness of using prisons) by providing one of the estimates needed for such an exercise: the difference between the recidivism rate of offenders formerly under electronic monitoring and the recidivism rate for offenders released from a standard prison. 1 See, for example, the discussions in Schwitzgebel (1969), Petersilia (1987), Schmidt and Curtis (1987), Morris and Tonry (1990), Tonry (1998), and Payne and Gainey (1998). Theoretically, the difference in these two recidivism rates is ambiguous. On the one hand, specific deterrence theory suggests that spending time under electronic monitoring rather than incarceration might make low punishment salient, implying a positive relationship between light punishment (electronic monitoring) and ulterior recidivism. On the other hand, several theories point out to a negative relationship. For example, imprisonment might be criminogenic through harsh prison conditions or peer effects that are not present under electronic monitoring. In particular, electronic monitoring could prevent contact with hardened criminals, or reduce the perception that society is =mean and =deserving of the crime it receives (one variation is in Sherman and Strang, 2007). Moreover, electronic monitoring could differ from prison in its effect on the improvement of skills (social, applied or cognitive) and labor market prospects.2 A simple comparison of recidivism rates across the prison and electronic monitoring samples, however, is typically unlikely to be very informative. There are at least two practical empirical problems in trying to derive a causal estimate, one of which can be called a problem of selection and the second a problem of differential risk of the target population."

In comparisons of risky lotteries, we argued, individuals' attention is drawn to those payoffs which are most different or salient relative to the average. In making choices, individuals overweight these salient payoffs relative to their objective probabilities. A simple formalization of such salience-based probability weighting provides an intuitive account of a variety of puzzling evidence in decision theory, such as Allais paradoxes and preference reversals. Salience theory naturally lends itself to the analysis of the demand for risky assets. After all, risky assets are lotteries evaluated in a context described by the alternative investments available in the market."

This is consistent both with the persistence of democratic institutions over time and with the transmission of democratic institutions from the local level to the national level."

However, empirical work has not been very kind to this proposition. There is no tendency for poor countries to grow faster than rich ones, over any reasonably long time horizon for which we have data (see Figure 1).1 Whatever convergence one can find is conditional: it depends on policies, institutions, and other country-specific circumstances. The only exceptions to the rule seem to be statesffregions within a unified economy such as the United States (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991).2 If growth rates are characterized by conditional instead of unconditional convergence, economies will tend towards different levels of income in the long-run."

9475,AER,2015-07-01,"Banking, Liquidity, and Bank Runs in an Infinite Horizon Economy","We develop an infinite horizon macroeconomic model of banking that allows for liquidity mismatch and bank runs. Whether a bank run equilibrium exists depends on bank balance sheets and an endogenous liquidation price for bank assets. While in normal times a bank run equilibrium may not exist, the possibility can arise in recessions. A run leads to a significant contraction in intermediation and aggregate economic activity. Anticipations of a run have harmful effects on the economy even if the run does not occur. We illustrate how the model can shed light on some key aspects of the recent financial crisis.",English,NA,NA,105,7,1,2011,2043,NA,Mark Gertler; Nobuhiro Kiyotaki,3730; 4255,Male; Male,English; Non-English,NA,Princeton U; New York U,G21; G33; E32; E23; E44; G01,w19129,2013-06-01,"Banking, Liquidity and Bank Runs in an Infinite-Horizon Economy","We develop a variation of the macroeconomic model with banking in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011) that allows for liquidity mismatch and bank runs as in Diamond and Dybvig (1983). As in Gertler and Kiyotaki, because bank net worth fluctuates with aggregate production, the spread between the expected rates of return on bank assets and deposits fluctuates counter-cyclically. However, because bank assets are less liquid than deposits, bank runs are possible as in Diamond and Dybvig. Whether a bank run equilibrium exists depends on bank balance sheets and an endogenously determined liquidation price for bank assets.

The first, summarized recently in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011), emphasizes how the depletion of bank capital in an economic downturn hinders banks ability to intermediate funds. Due to agency problems (and possibly also regulatory constraints) a bank's ability to raise funds depends on its capital. Portfolios losses experienced in a downturn accordingly lead to losses of bank capital that are increasing in the degree of leverage."
